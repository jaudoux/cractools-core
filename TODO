# Update libs
- [x] Manage GFF files instead of using Ensembl API (Optional).
- [ ] Integrate SAMTOOLS tabix API to read BAM files quicker
- [ ] Measure Interval::Query::File vs tabix
- [x] When Querying and interval we want to retrieve the data and the interval that is associated to this data
- [X] Multi-thread cractools-count procedure
- [ ] Create a library to easily create test that use files as __GFF__
- [X] Place binaries buisiness code into Module under CracTools::App:: namespace
      This way we will be able to test all the code properly!
- [ ] Test cractools-extract script
- [x] Add multi-bam support for cractools-count
- [x] Figure out why cractools-count does not give the exact same counts
- [ ] Use Stein Perl-BAM library instead of piping the samtools view command

# Update binaries
- [ ] Make CracTools count faster!
- [ ] Make cractools-count PE aware, to remove eventual ambiguity in counts

# New Modules
- [ ] Add a class for generating standard log files like [process:time] message
- [ ] Place cractools-extract business logic under CracTools::App to allow POD documentation and testing
- [ ] Create some base class that all scripts/binaries should inherit : CracTools::App.pm ?!
- [ ] Create a CracTools::GenomicParrallel class do easily multi-threads script on genomic chunks base
      like in cractools-extract
- [ ] Developper guide should be a POD document
