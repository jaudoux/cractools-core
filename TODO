- [x] Manage GFF files instead of using Ensembl API (Optional).
- [ ] Integrate SAMTOOLS tabix API to read BAM files quicker

- [x] When Querying and interval we want to retrieve the data and the interval that is associated to this data
- [ ] Add a class for generating standard log files like [process:time] message
- [ ] Multi-thread cractools-count procedure
- [ ] Create a library to easily create test that use files as __GFF__
- [ ] Place binaries buisiness code into Module under CracTools::App:: namespace
      This way we will be able to test all the code properly!
- [ ] Test cractools-filterN script
- [ ] Test cractools-extract script
- [x] Add multi-bam support for cractools-count
