- [x] Manage GFF files instead of using Ensembl API (Optional).
- [ ] Integrate SAMTOOLS tabix API to read BAM files quicker
- [ ] Measure Interval::Query::File vs tabix
- [x] When Querying and interval we want to retrieve the data and the interval that is associated to this data
- [ ] Add a class for generating standard log files like [process:time] message
- [X] Multi-thread cractools-count procedure
- [ ] Create a library to easily create test that use files as __GFF__
- [X] Place binaries buisiness code into Module under CracTools::App:: namespace
      This way we will be able to test all the code properly!
- [ ] Test cractools-filterN script
- [ ] Test cractools-extract script
- [x] Add multi-bam support for cractools-count
- [x] Figure out why cractools-count does not give the exact same counts
- [ ] Make CracTools count faster!
- [ ] Make cractools-count PE aware, to remove eventual ambiguity in counts
