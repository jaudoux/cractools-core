What is it? 
----------

CracTools-core is the cornerstone of the CracTools. It is a toolbox that aim to
ease the build of pipelines in the field of bioinformatics. It has been
originally built to produce pipelines on top of
[CRAC](http://crac.gforge.inria.fr/) software, but you can use the
CracTools-core tools in an other context.  It has a lot of built-in features to
parse file, intersect biological events, integrate annotation, sharing
configuration.

CracTools-core is also shiped with some binaries that are directly based on the CracTools-core API:

- `cractools extract`: this tools aims to extract biological events (splices, 
  snp, indels, chimeras) from BAM files produced by  CRAC's analysis.
- `cractools gtf2togff3`: is a tools that convert gtf annotation files to gff3
  format that is the standard in CracTools.
- More tools are about to come (soon)

Installation
------------

Installation is stupidly simple, just download the tarball and run the following command:

  cpanm CracTools-core-version.tar.gz

You will need an internet connection for cpanm that will download missing modules from CPAN.
You will also need c++ compiler to be installed for Set::IntervalTree distribution.

Modules
-------

### `CracTools::Config`

Is a module that aim to integrate a common configuration file among all the
cractools pipelines. It automatically load the configuration file by looking to
diverse locations, then it provides methods to retrieved the variables declared
in the configuration file.

### `CracTools::Interval::Query`

Is a module to store and query variables associated with genomic intervals. It
is based on the interval tree datastructure provided by `Set::IntervalTree`.

### `CracTools::Interval::Query::File`

Is a submodule of `CracTools::Interval::Query` that read 

### `CracTools::SAMReader` and `CracTools::SAMReader::SAMline`

Are modules that provide iterators and objects to easily read SAM/BAM file
generated by CRAC and provide dedicated methods to extract additional fields
added by CRAC to each record.

### `CracTools::Annotator`

Is a modules based on `CracTools::Interval::Query::File` that provides powerfull
methods to query annotation files and priorise
